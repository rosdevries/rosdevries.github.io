<p>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, </p>

<p>This is {!Case.OwnerFirstName}, I look after Customer Experience for {!Account.Region__c}. Your account has been highlighted as a new customer who could benefit from a call - and so I'd like to extend you a personal welcome and offer our services, where relevant.</p> 

<p>Let's schedule a complimentary call, to: </p>

	<ul><li>Get you started with your account, by recommending videos, guides and other resources </li>
		<li>Structure your ideal billing plan </li>
		<li>Outline which integrations are available for connecting your business apps </li>
		<li>Connect you with our support team </li>
<li>Design and create your emails, with our Professional Services team </li></ul>

<p>In addition, we would like to ask a few questions about your email marketing goals, to inform our internal teams as to how we can improve our service for you. This is not a sales call - we just want to assist you with getting results.</p> 

<p><br/><span style="padding:10px; background-color: #7856ff;color: #fff;border-radius:3px;"><strong>To book an orientation &amp; training call with me, <a href="https://cm.chilipiper.com/book/me/{!User.EmployeeNumber}?caseid={!Case.Id}&type=cm-200club" style="color: #fff;font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">please schedule a time in my calendar here</a>.</strong></span></p>
